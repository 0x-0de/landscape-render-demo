# landscape-render-demo
A graphical demo featuring a first-person camera roaming around a massive, infinite landscape with a very high draw distance.

This was originally a game project I worked on in November 2021. I scrapped it after discovering the horrors of floating-point rounding error.
It uses OpenGL, with GLEW and GLFW as dependencies.
